This program is released to the public domain by the author on
February 15, 1989 at the Software Development Conference,

Should you desire to communicate with the author, the preferred method

OPUS board.  You may contact it directly at 504-244-1417 or via net

The author wishes to acknowledge and thank Jack Purdum and Tim Leslie
of Ecosoft for their assistance and support.  In addition to Jack and
Tim, Steve Russell of SLR Systems was also of invaluable assistance.
All helped in this project by debugging and offering their expert
advice and guidance.  They always had time for me seemingly whenever
I requested it.

Finally, this program is dedicated to the memory of my father-in-law,
Mariano "Val" Valentino.  The only request the author makes for
using the program is that the program name be left as "VAL" in his
memory.
